---------------------------------------------

When a search term is submitted, the application sends a `GET` request like `/?search=festival` and responds wth a results page.

The search term is an `<h1>` element.

Viewing the page source or using the browser inspector shows that the raw search string appears between HTML tags with no encoding;
Special characters like `<` and `>` are preserved.

This means that any HTML markup entered into the search box will be interpreted by the browser as real HTML/JavaScript, not escaped text.

---------------------------------------------------

As the input is reflected directly in HTML body context and nothing is encoded.

PAYLOAD: `<script>alert('bob')</script>`

>The browser parses the <script> block in this context and executes `alert('bob')`, showing a JavaScript alert dialog and solving the lab.
